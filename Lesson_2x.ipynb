They have provided a dataset, and they want us to showcase our skills by giving a sneak peek of what we can understand from the data. As this is our first assignment, the management want everybody to take the task and create a repository with the code for the analysis.\n",

In Google Colab, you get an ephemeral virtual machine (with RAM and GB), where you can create notebooks and run scripts and even terminal commands. In Codespaces, you can spin up an ephemeral virtual machine (with RAM and GB) where you can sync your files with the repository. Let's learn some basic commands."

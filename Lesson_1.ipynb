        "In common usage, data is a collection of discrete or continuous values\n",
        "that convey information, describing the quantity, quality, fact,\n",
        "statistics, other basic units of meaning, or simply sequences of symbols\n",
        "that may be further interpreted formally.\n",
        "Data are usually organized into structures such as tables that provide\n",

        "computational, and machine learning methods to extract insights from data\n",

        "Barias thinks that we can provide a solution for each task assigned, given our background and skills. The mision for the company is \"To serve companies by extracting actionable insights from their data in an automated way, using the latest technology in AI\". The vision, as told by Barias, is to convert this local company into a multinational referent for every data science need.\n",

        "In computing, a shell is a computer program that exposes an operating system's services to a human user or other programs. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system. [6]\n",
